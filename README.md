# Client Project
Retrieve a client information with CURD functions

Project is in Asp.Net C# using visual studio 2013.
I have used basic functionality of bootstrap and jquery.

If you click on dropdown menu for Clients, you can create new client information.
if you click on Clients - View, you can see the clients info added before as well as update or delete any clients info.
